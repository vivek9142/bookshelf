//copy all the data most of App.exercise.js data into context module and we can refactor there.

//a- we'll get rid of getUser, getting the user info and what we render based on user's information
//b - we'll only render the part of app based on the user 

//c- go to index.extra-2.js for use of AuthProvider within app
